                <p> This is why I like this recipe: list your reasons.</p>
                <p> I like pozole because the soup texture is very delightful</p>
                <p> the flavor is very good</p>
                <p> during the holidays the warm soup taste really good with other types of food for example "tacos dorados" The filled tortilla is then crisp-fried or deep-fried. The dish is often topped with condiments such as sour cream and guacamole.</p>
